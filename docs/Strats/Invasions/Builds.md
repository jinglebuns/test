# Healers
Always run void gauntlet Oblivion. Essence Rupture is also good. Tether maybe good? [[Testing#Tether on invasion bosses]]

# Tanks

Sword/Shield necessary. Great Axe if lacking melee dps for bombers, Hammer otherwise.

# Melee DPS
Always equip Great Axe.

# Ranged DPS
Bow/Musket

# Mage
Always equip Fire Staff. Flamethrower is underrated.
