    2. [[Builds#Tanks]]
    3. [[Builds#Melee DPS]]
    4. [[Builds#Ranged DPS]]
    5. [[Builds#Mage]]

## Planning
1. Explain [[Layout|Groups]] 
2. Explain siege and item usage - Ballistas for destroying siege, repeaters for killing bosses, oil vats on cooldown when bosses are at gate, horns used liberally for multiple bosses. Siege players need ammo pouches to refill empty guns, gate players can buy mines to place ON THE GATE for bosses. Rotating players need to stay stocked with haste pots.
3. Explain bosses and rotations - If you have aggro of a boss pull them away from gate. Rotation groups will move to gates with bosses.
4. Go over skull strategy - DO NOT HIT SKULLS. One player will take aggro and keep lasers away from others. Alternatively kill only right eye(from our perspective) and then leave skull alive.
